## Cloud computing, designed for people

The internet turned personal computers into gateways for web applications, empowering people to communicate and interact with humans and machines around the globe. While many of these apps are designed for people, the entire experience of using a computer on the internet is not. People have lost the autonomy and abilities present in personal computing: they don't own their data and they navigate a multitude of incompatible apps that don't work in concert on behalf of the user.

We believe that designing the entire computer around people provides a better experience: the personal cloud aims to bring this intent computers on the internet. It prioritizes the individual user as opposed to an enterprise or application as the starting point.

A personal cloud differs from conventional personal computers in that it exists on the web. Not only does it serve as a private and autonomous space to [use](/docs/en/use) your [apps](/docs/en/use/space-apps/) and [data](/docs/en/use/your-data/collections), but it also functions as a personal portal to and from the world. Not only can you author content, but it facilitates sharing, receiving, and engaging with others directly, acting as a launchpad for interactions between your content and the wider world, both human and machine. This includes the [discovery](https://deta.space/discovery) of the creations of others that you can use in a personal context.

### For users

In the [traditional cloud model](/docs/en/learn/pc-what#public-cloud-application-model), the company who provides an application holds a lot of power. If the company decides it's not worth it to keep the app running and shuts down the infrastructure, happy users lose access. They also can't easily interact with, extend, or delete their own application data. Or add a custom domain, or more RAM to a sluggish service.

On the [personal cloud](/docs/en/learn/pc-what#personal-cloud-application-model), this all changes. Users can install and uninstall apps on a whim, with fine-grained control. They can inspect, modify, extend, and export all their data. Since everything is in one place, it can integrate directly. For users who are also developers, the control is extremely powerful: everything is raw material to build and explore with.

### For developers

Using the cloud providers of today, web developers with an idea need to do a lot to bring it to the world. They have to code their idea, but they also have to create, pay for, and operate the infrastructure to run it. This is a lot of work. For apps to serve users around the globe, this barrier usually requires teams of operational experts fighting [a large number of cloud tools](https://landscape.cncf.io/).

Using the personal cloud, things are entirely different. Individuals can [build](/docs/en/build) something for themselves, assuming they're the only user. They can stop there, if they want. Or they can [publish](/docs/en/publish) it to the world, and see it run everywhere. Anyone else with an internet connection can install the app, in another personal cloud. Throughout the entire process, the developer doesn't think about operating anything ✨ at all ✨.
