Space is unfortuantely shutting down. You can export and keep your [Horizon](/docs/en/use/interface), [Apps](/docs/en/use/space-apps) and [Collections](/docs/en/use/your-data/collections) data.

All exports will be a `zip` archive that you can download. 

## Export Your Horizon Data

Click on the Deta logo in bottom bar (teletype) and click on `Export Your Horizon`. 

Then you can create an export and download it after it's completed. You have to click on `Refresh` to see if the export job is done.

The unzipped archive will contain the Horizon's icon and other data you saved in your Horizon.
