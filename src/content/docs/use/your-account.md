# Deleting Your Account 

You can submit a request to delete your account any time. We will delete your account and data within 30 days of receiving your request.

In order to delete your account, login to your [Space Dashboard](https://deta.space), open the Teletype (command bar), click on **Settings** and navigate to the **Account** tab.

Deleting your account will delete all your data, including your collections and installed apps. You will not be able to recover your data after deleting your account. 

If you are a developer and have published apps on Deta Space, [learn what happens to your apps after deleting your account](#your-published-apps-after-deleting-your-account).

## Your published apps after deleting your account

If you have published an app on Deta Space that has been installed by anyone else other than yourself, _the app will continue to be available on Deta Space even after you delete your account_.
This is to ensure that the app continues to be available to users who have installed it.

If the app was a listed app on Discovery, it will be unlisted after you delete your account. For the existing app release page on Discovery, we will add a note that the app is no longer maintained.

If no user has installed the app, the app will be also be deleted.
