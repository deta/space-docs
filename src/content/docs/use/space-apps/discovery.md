## App Discovery Pages

If you find an app from the Discovery home page that you’re curious about, clicking it will bring you to an individual app’s Discovery page. You may also land on an app’s Discovery page from an external site, or if someone shared a Discovery link with you.

The Discovery Page looks like this.

## Installing Apps from Discovery

If you are interested in trying an app you find on Discovery, click the pink **Install on Space** button. This will kick off the process of installing the given app to your own personal cloud. A pink progress bar will gradually fill the button until the installation completes. Once the installation is finished, the button will be replaced by a **View on Canvas** button with a green check mark in the top corner.

In the background, Space is pulling a copy of the app from Discovery and provisioning the compute and data resources to run the app out of your Space. Once it is complete, you will be able to find the app on your Canvas. Your app comes with its own, unique domain. It also comes pre-wired to its own unique Collection for storing associated data.
