Your Space’s user interface uses two primary components that you’ll interact with the most: **Canvas** and **Teletype**.

# Canvas

After you signup for Space and complete onboarding, you will see something like this:

![ui-canvas](/docs-assets/use/ui-canvas.png)

This is your **Canvas**. Canvas is like your desktop, but for your Space. The individual items that you see on your Canvas are **Tiles**. You’ll get a Tile on your Canvas for every app you install, and every project you are building (if you’re a developer).

If you click on a Tile, it will open that app or project. You can also reorganize all the Tiles on your Canvas by dragging and dropping any Tile.

Space itself also provides a few **System Tiles**, which include:

- [Discovery](/docs/en/use/space-apps/discovery): Where you find and install Space apps
- [Docs](/docs/en/): A link to the docs, to read about Space
- [Collections](/docs/en/use/your-data/collections): Where you manage your data
- [Builder](/docs/en/build/fundemantals/development/builder): Where you build Space applications (available for developers)

# Teletype

You also may have noticed the little bar at the bottom of your Canvas. This is **Teletype**.

Teletype will follow you around Space, helping you navigate and interact with individual apps and Space itself. You can navigate Teletype using your keyboard or your mouse. If you are somewhere in Space and aren’t sure what to do, opening Teletype is often a great first step.

## Teletype Actions

Just starting to type, or clicking Teletype, will expand it with a list of **Actions** available to you. Actions help you do something in Space via Teletype.

<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="border-radius: 5px; width: 90%; max-width:500px;" src="/docs-assets/use/ui-3.png"/> </div>

Available Actions are context specific and will change, depending on where you are in your Space. You can execute individual Actions within Teletype by double clicking, or hitting enter, which will do something.

Some actions, like **Go to Docs**, are just links outside of your Space to things like the Docs (where we are at).

Other actions, like **Settings**, will open up a Space context menu for you to interact with.

<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="border-radius: 5px; width: 90%; max-width:500px;" src="/docs-assets/use/ui-4.png"/> </div>

More advanced Actions, like **Search Installed Apps**, will allow you to quickly do something without leaving Teletype itself.

<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="border-radius: 5px; width: 90%; max-width:500px;" src="/docs-assets/use/ui-5.png"/> </div>

For every Action that is highlighted, Teletype will hint at what you can do in the bottom right corner. The options hinted are both clickable and accessible via a keyboard shortcut. In the above case, **Enter** will open the highlighted app, while **Command + X** will display a list of extra actions the highlighted app offers.

<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="border-radius: 5px; width: 90%; max-width:300px;" src="/docs-assets/use/ui-6.png"/> </div>
