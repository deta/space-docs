<PublishCloud/>

With Deta Space, you can [build](/docs/en/build) something for yourself, and stop there. 
But thanks to [the personal cloud](/docs/en/learn/personal-cloud), you're also just one step away from sharing your app with the whole world. This is done via **Publishing** an app to [Deta Discovery](https://deta.space/discovery).

Deta Discovery is a global library of software that's compatible with Space. It's open to anyone to contribute to and use. 
When you publish an app to Discovery, you can share it with a limited audience, or make it massively available to people around the world, without thinking about operating it ✨ at all ✨.
