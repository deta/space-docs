excerpt: Base is the fastest way to store an item in a Base. If an item already exists under the given key, it will be replaced. In the case you do not provide a key, Base will automatically generate a 12-character string as a key. Base can also be used to store any additional data.

A Space app is different from a normal web app. Instead of one central app that serves many users, each user on Space will get their own personal copy of an app, in their own personal cloud. This is a simple but powerful difference that removes much of the complexity in building and distributing apps on the internet. It also pushes the boundaries of what a web app is, and what it can do.

Here we have another paragraph which just displays the current margins. It also is a placeholder and should be replaced at some point, or not?
Maybe it will jsut stay like this the entire time.

Here is an example of an unordered list:

- a simple authentication model that “just works”
- support for your favorite programming languages & frameworks
  - We can even have neste items
  - Another one
    - and even a third
- a suite of included services, from storing data to talking with AI models

With these tools, you should find it easy to build all sorts of internet experiences for yourself — from simple websites to full stack applications that tie into the latest advances in AI. Once you have, it's even easier to publish your creation to almost anyone else in the world.

There could also be an ordered list:

2. Some other cool item
3. some [Link Maybe](#)?
