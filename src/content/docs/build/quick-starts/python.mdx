This quickstart assumes that you have:

- A [Deta Space account](https://deta.space/signup)
- [The Space CLI](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/space-cli) installed and authenticated on your machine
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your machine

> üí° Currently, Space supports Python 3.8 and Python 3.9, with plans to add support for Python 3.10 soon.
> We recommend using a Python version manager like [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install Python on your system. This will allow you to quickly install and use different versions of Python.

## Create a Python App

First, create a directory to contain the source code of your app and navigate to it.

```bash
mkdir python-app && cd python-app
```

Next, create a virtual environment to manage the dependencies for your app and activate it with:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è It is important to exclude the virtual environment directory from your source code during deployment (`space push`) in order to avoid conflicts and compatibility issues. The Space CLI automatically ignores the `venv` and `.venv` directories by default. However, if your virtual environment directory has a different name, you should add it to the `.spaceignore` file.

We‚Äôll also install a web framework and a web server. For this guide, we‚Äôll use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) with [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) with [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/), but feel free to use other frameworks and web servers of your choice if you prefer.

In your text editor, create a new file called `requirements.txt`, and add the following dependencies into it:

<LangTabs>
  <Fragment slot="fastapi">
  ```
  fastapi
  uvicorn
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="flask">
  ```
  Flask
  gunicorn
  ```
  </Fragment>
</LangTabs>


Then, install these dependencies to your local virtual environment with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a new file called `main.py`. Then, add the following code:

<LangTabs>
  <Fragment slot="fastapi">
  ```python
  from fastapi import FastAPI

  app = FastAPI()

  @app.get("/")
  def root():
      return "Hello from Space! üöÄ"
```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="flask">
  ```python
  from flask import Flask

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route("/")
  def root():
      return "Hello from Space! üöÄ"
```
  </Fragment>
</LangTabs>


This code sets up a basic web server that listens on the port specified by the `PORT` environment variable.

> üí° Make sure your app is configured to listen on the port defined by the `PORT` [environment variable](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/the-space-runtime/micros#micro-environment-variables).

## Create a Space Project

[Space projects](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/development/projects) allow you to build, test, and use apps on Deta Space. They are also a (optional) launchpad for releasing them to the public.

```bash
space new
```

You will be prompted to enter a name for your project. The CLI will display a generated configuration for the app and prompt you to confirm. 

Once confirmed, the project will be created along with a [`Spacefile`](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/the-space-runtime#the-spacefile). 
The `Spacefile` contains the configuration for your [Micro](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/the-space-runtime/micros) and a `.space` directory that stores project information and links it to your project.

```yaml
# Spacefile Docs: https://go.deta.dev/docs/spacefile/v0
v: 0
micros:
  - name: python-app
    src: .
    engine: python3.9
    primary: true
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently, the Spacefile with the generated configuration is based on the old standard of running Python apps on Space, which requires a `main.py` file at the root directory of the Micro's source code with the app instance named as `app`. We recommend updating the configuration in the Spacefile to explicitly define the command to start your app with the `run` command:


<LangTabs>
  <Fragment slot="fastapi">
  ```diff
  # Spacefile Docs: https://go.deta.dev/docs/spacefile/v0
  v: 0
  micros:
    - name: python-app
      src: .
      engine: python3.9
      primary: true
  +   run: uvicorn main:app
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="flask">
  ```diff
  # Spacefile Docs: https://go.deta.dev/docs/spacefile/v0
  v: 0
  micros:
    - name: python-app
      src: .
      engine: python3.9
      primary: true
  +   run: gunicorn main:app
  ```
  </Fragment>
</LangTabs>


> ‚ö†Ô∏è If the CLI fails to generate a configuration for your app, you can configure it manually. For more information, please refer to the [Spacefile](/docs/en/build/reference/spacefile) reference.

## Developing Locally

You can run your app on your local machine, in a way that [emulates Space](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/development/local-development) for development. To do so, you need to define a startup command for your  app‚Äôs development server using the `dev` command in the Spacefile.

<LangTabs>
  <Fragment slot="fastapi">
  ```diff
  # Spacefile Docs: https://go.deta.dev/docs/spacefile/v0
  v: 0
  micros:
    - name: python-app
      src: .
      engine: python3.9
      primary: true
      run: uvicorn main:app
  +   dev: .venv/bin/uvicorn main:app --reload
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="flask">
  ```diff
  # Spacefile Docs: https://go.deta.dev/docs/spacefile/v0
  v: 0
  micros:
    - name: python-app
      src: .
      engine: python3.9
      primary: true
      run: gunicorn main:app
  +   dev: .venv/bin/flask --app main run
  ```
  </Fragment>
</LangTabs>

Once you define the `dev` command for the Micro in the Spacefile, you can start the development server by running the following command:

```
space dev
```

## Run it on Space

To deploy your app to Space, simply run:

```diff
space push
```

This will validate your Spacefile, package and upload your source code to the Space build pipeline, and stream logs of the whole process on your terminal. 
Once the build process is complete, your [Builder Instance](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/development/local-development). Open it in your browser to test and use a live copy of your app on the internet.

> üí° You can use `space push --open` to open the builder instance in your browser after successful deployement and update of the builder instance.

Congratulations! üéâ You have successfully built, deployed and got your first Python app on Space. üöÄ
