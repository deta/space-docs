<BuildCloud/>

Welcome to Deta Space. You’re on an exciting journey building for a whole new cloud computer that's designed around you. We’re glad to have you here.

Unlike other cloud computers you’ve built for, Space is also a personal computer. You can build apps for yourself and you can [use](/docs/en/use) and extend [3rd party apps](/docs/en/use/space-apps/discovery) that put you in the drivers seat.  

You can also [share your creations with the world](/docs/en/publish). And when you do, others can run your apps on their own cloud computer. 
What this means is that you don't need to think about servers, databases, global availability, any of it. 

This section is going to help you get started building for Space. Check out:
- the [New App Guide](/docs/en/build/new-apps) to build a new app
- the [Quick Starts](/docs/en/build/quick-starts) to get a "Hello World" running in your favorite programming language
- an [overview of Space apps](/docs/en/build/space-apps)
- the [Fundamentals](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/) section for a deep dive on building for Space

Let’s get going.
