| --------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| `name`    | `str`           | The name of the Drive. |
| `host`    | `str` \| `None` | The host of the Drive. |

### Put

```py
def put(
    name: str,
    data: str | bytes | io.TextIOBase | io.BufferedIOBase | io.RawIOBase,
    *,
    content_type: str | None = None,
) -> str:
```

```py
def put(
    name: str,
    *,
    path: str,
    content_type: str | None = None,
) -> str:
```

You must pass either `data` or `path`, but not both.

If `name` is not a non-empty string, raises a `ValueError`.
If neither or both `data` and `path` are passed, raises a `ValueError`.
Returns an `str` containing the name of the file.
If the operation did not complete successfully, raises an `Exception`.

```py
drive.put("hello.txt", data="Hello world!")
drive.put("example.txt", path="path/to/example.txt")
```

## DriveStreamingBody

The `DriveStreamingBody` class provides methods to read the content of a file from a Drive.

### Read

```py
def read(size: int | None = None) -> bytes:
```

Reads all or up to the next `size` bytes. Calling `read` after all the content has been read will return empty bytes.

### Iterate Chunks

```py
def iter_chunks(chunk_size: int = 1024) -> Iterator[bytes]:
```

Returns an iterator that yields chunks of bytes of `chunk_size` at a time.

### Iterate Lines

```py
def iter_lines(chunk_size: int = 1024) -> Iterator[bytes]:
```

Returns an iterator that yields lines from the stream. Bytes of `chunk_size` at a time is read from the raw stream and lines are yielded from there. The line delimiter is always `b'\n'`.

### Close

```py
def close():
```

Closes the stream.

### Closed

```py
@property
def closed() -> bool:
```

Returns `True` if the stream has been closed.
