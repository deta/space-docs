Deta Base is a fully-managed, fast, scalable and secure NoSQL database with a focus on end-user simplicity. You can use Deta Base as part of a [Space App](/docs/en/build/space-apps), or on its own as part of a [Headless Collection](/docs/en/use/your-data/collections#headless-collections).


Outside of Space Apps, you can interact with Deta Base through a [Graphical User Interface](/docs/en/use/your-data/guis#base-ui), [SDK](/docs/en/build/reference/sdk/base), or [HTTP API](/docs/en/build/reference/http-api/base). Authentication to Base happens via [Data Keys](/docs/en/use/your-data/collections#data-keys).
