The Deta library is the easiest way to store and retrieve data from your Deta Base or Deta Drive in a Collection. 
Currently, we support JavaScript (Node + Browser), Python 3 and Go. [Drop us a line on Discord](https://go.deta.dev/discord) if you want us to support your favorite language.

Deta provides SDK packages for [Base](./base) and [Drive](./drive) from your code.
The SDKs are available for the following languages:

- Python
- JavaScript
- Go

> ℹ️ If you are using the Deta SDK within a [Deta Micro](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/the-space-runtime/micros), you must include `deta` in your `package.json` file to install the latest sdk version.

## Instantiating

To start working with your Base, you need to import the Deta class and initialize it. 
To authenticate with Space, you need to either use the [`space dev`](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/development/local-development) command or provide a [Data Key](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/data-storage#data-keys) in an environment variable called `DETA_PROJECT_KEY`.
See [here](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/data-storage) for detailed information.

Once you're authenticated, you can instantiate a subclass called Base with a database name of your choosing or Drive with a drive name of your choosing.

Deta Bases and Drives are created for you automatically when you start using them.

/* code example - python */

```python
from deta import Deta  # Import Deta

# Initialize
deta = Deta()

# This how to connect to or create a database.
db = deta.Base("simple_db")

# This how to connect to or create a drive.
db = deta.Drive("my_store")

# You can create as many as you want without additional charges.
books = deta.Base("books")
```

/* code example - node */

```javascript
const { Deta } = require('deta'); // import Deta

// Initialize
const deta = Deta(); 

// This how to connect to or create a database.
const db = deta.Base('simple_db'); 

// This how to connect to or create a drive.
const drive = deta.Drive('my_store'); 

// You can create as many as you want.
const books = deta.Base('books'); 
```


> ⚠️ Your [Data Key](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/data-storage#data-keys) is confidential and meant to be used by you. Anyone who has your [Data Key](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/data-storage#data-keys) can access your database. Please, do not share it or commit it in your code.
