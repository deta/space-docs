The Deta library is the easiest way to store and retrieve data from your [Deta Base](./base) and [Deta Drive](./drive) in a Collection.
Currently, we support JavaScript (Node + Browser), Python 3 and Go.

You'll first need to [install](#installing) and [instantiate](#instatiating) your SDK, before you can interact with Base or Drive.

Once you have, if you're someone who learns by theory, see the reference documentation:
- [Base SDK](/docs/en/build/reference/sdk/base)
- [Drive SDK](/docs/en/build/reference/sdk/drive)

If you're someone who learns by example, there are also extensive [code examples](/docs/en/build/reference/sdk/examples).

> ℹ️ If you are using the Deta SDK within a [Deta Micro](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/the-space-runtime/micros), you must include `deta` in your `package.json` file to install the latest sdk version.

## Instantiating

To start working with your Base or Drive, you need to import the Deta class and initialize it.
To authenticate with Space, you need to either use the [`space dev`](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/development/local-development) command or provide a [Data Key](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/data-storage#data-keys) in an environment variable called `DETA_PROJECT_KEY`.
See [here](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/data-storage#data-keys) for detailed information.

Once you're authenticated, you can instantiate a subclass called Base with a database name of your choosing or Drive with a drive name of your choosing.

Deta Bases and Drives are created for you automatically when you start using them.

# You can create as many as you want without additional charges.
