The Deta library is the easiest way to store and retrieve data from your [Deta Base](./base) and [Deta Drive](./drive) in a Collection.
Currently, we support JavaScript (Node + Browser), Python 3 and Go.

You'll first need to [install](#installing) and [instantiate](#instatiating) your SDK, before you can interact with Base or Drive.

Once you have, if you're someone who learns by theory, see the reference documentation:
- [Base SDK](/docs/en/build/reference/sdk/base)
- [Drive SDK](/docs/en/build/reference/sdk/drive)

If you're someone who learns by example, there are also extensive [code examples](/docs/en/build/reference/sdk/examples).

> ℹ️ If you are using the Deta SDK within a [Deta Micro](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/the-space-runtime/micros), you must include `deta` in your `package.json` file to install the latest sdk version.

## Instantiating

To start working with your Base or Drive, you need to import the Deta class and initialize it.

The SDK needs to be [authenticated](#authentication) with Space to talk with a Base or Drive. 

Once you're authenticated, you can instantiate a subclass called Base with a database name of your choosing or Drive with a drive name of your choosing.

Deta Bases and Drives are created for you automatically when you start using them.

    <Fragment slot="py">
```python
from deta import Deta  # Import Deta

# Initialize
deta = Deta()

# This how to connect to or create a database.
db = deta.Base("simple_db")

# This how to connect to or create a drive.
db = deta.Drive("my_store")

# You can create as many as you want without additional charges.
books = deta.Base("books")
```
</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="pyAsync">
```python
from deta import Deta  # Import Deta

db = deta.AsyncBase("simple_db")

# This how to connect to or create a drive. (not async)
db = deta.Drive("my_store")

# You can create as many as you want without additional charges.

// This how to connect to or create a database.
const db = deta.Base('simple_db');

// This how to connect to or create a drive.
const drive = deta.Drive('my_store');

// You can create as many as you want.
const books = deta.Base('books');

> ⚠️ Do not use the browser version of the SDK with your secret key hard coded. You are exposing your key. The browser SDK is strictly meant for use in Space Apps' private routes.

  "github.com/deta/deta-go/service/base"

  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("failed to init new Base instance:", err)
    return
  }
}

</Fragment>
</RuntimeTabs>

## Authentication

Authentication is managed for you when developing locally with the `space dev` command, 
when using the SDK inside a [Micro](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/the-space-runtime/micros), 
or when using the SDK in a Space app running in the browser (the SDK will not authenticate on [public micros or public routes](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/the-space-runtime/authentication#public-micros-and-routes)).

Alternatively, you can authenticate with the Deta SDK by providing a [Data Key](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/data-storage#data-keys) in an environment variable called `DETA_PROJECT_KEY`.

> ⚠️ Your [Data Key](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/data-storage#data-keys) is confidential and meant to be used by you. Anyone who has your [Data Key](/docs/en/build/fundamentals/data-storage#data-keys) can access your database. Please, do not share it, commit it in your code, or use it in the Browser.
