Scheduled actions allow an app to perform certain tasks on a specific interval. These tasks can be anything the developer builds into their app, from a cleanup job to automated data aggregation or revalidation.

Developers have to purposely enable and setup a scheduled action. When they do, they can choose a default interval which the action will run on. After installing an app, its scheduled actions are automatically enabled and set to run on this default interval specified by the dev. However, as a user, you can change the interval or disable an action from running at any point.

### Managing Schedules

To view and manage the scheduled actions of an app, open the app’s settings by clicking on the 3 dots (…) next to an app’s icon on the Canvas, then click "Settings" and then switch to the “Schedules” tab. If the app doesn’t have any scheduled actions, the tab won’t be there.

In the “Schedules” tab you will see a list of all the scheduled actions belonging to the app, whether or not they are enabled, what interval they are set to, and when they will run next. If an action is enabled you’ll see a “Configure” button which can be used to change the interval:

### Changing a Schedule

To change a scheduled action’s interval, click the “Configure” button in the “Schedules” tab in the app’s Settings. You will be shown options to choose between different interval types ranging from minutes to months and anything in between.

When you select an interval, the UI will show you when the action would run next. Once you are happy, click “Save” to schedule the action on the new interval.
