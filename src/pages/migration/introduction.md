Welcome! If you're coming from [Deta Cloud](https://www.deta.sh/) and you're looking for more information about what the move to [Deta Space](https://deta.space/) means for your Cloud Projects, you're in the right place.

This hub has resources on how to migrate, alongside some information about the Deta Space in relation to Deta Cloud, and the Cloud Sunset plan.

## Deta Cloud Deprecation Information

On merge day (February 14, 2023), Deta Cloud will enter legacy status and Deta Space will become Deta's main product. A few things will happen:

1. `deta.sh` and `web.deta.sh` will redirect to pages on `deta.space`.
2. Creating new Projects or new Micros on Deta Cloud will stop working.
3. Existing Projects on Deta Cloud will continue to run, uninterrupted with support until June 1, 2023.
4. Migration for Micros, Bases, and Drives will be strongly recommended and available until June 1, 2023.
5. On June 1, 2023, Deta Cloud Projects will no longer be supported and unmigrated resources will be removed.

How will all this work?

There is supported [Legacy Mode](/migration/learn-more/legacy-mode) for managing Deta Cloud Projects and resources until June 1.

There are also Migration Paths available (and strongly recommended) until June 1.
