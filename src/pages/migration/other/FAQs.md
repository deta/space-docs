### What exactly does "deta.sh is retiring" mean?

It means the following:
- The ability to create new Projects and Micros on deta.sh aka Deta Cloud has been disabled since the merge day (Feb 14, 2023).
- You can still access your existing Deta Cloud Projects and Micros on [Deta Space](https://deta.space) in [Legacy Cloud app](https://deta.space/migration/learn-more/legacy-mode#the-legacy-cloud-app), available through your Deta Space Canvas.
- You can deploy code, make changes, and save data on your Micros, Bases, and Drives on Deta Cloud until June 1st, 2023.
- On June 1st, 2023, everything on Deta Cloud will be removed and will no longer be accessible.

If you encounter difficulties migrating your cloud Micros to Space Apps, you can contact the team at team@deta.space for assistance.


### Will my Micros, Bases, Drives Continue to work?

Yes, they will continue to work until June 1, 2023 12:00 AM UTC+2. After that they will be sunset.

You will continue to be able to update Micros as well as use your Bases and Drives until June 1, but you won't be able to create new Projects or Micros.

We recommend moving [Bases and Drives to Collections](/migration/migration-guides/import-a-project) and [Micros to Space Apps](/migration/migration-guides/migrate-a-micro).

### Are custom domains and sub-domains available on Deta Space?

[Custom domains](https://deta.space/manual/features/custom-domains) are available on Deta Space. Custom sub-domains (`<sub>.deta.dev`) are not currently available.

### Can I run a cron job in Space?

Yes, you can run up multiple [Scheduled Actions](https://deta.space/manual/features/scheduled-actions) in a single Space App.


### Will VISOR come to Space?

No plans to bring VISOR to Space, but we plan to continuously improve Logs in Deta Space.

### Is Space free like Deta Cloud was? What are the limits?

Like Deta Cloud, Deta Space is free for developers building apps. For usage, free tier limits and a premium "Deta Adventurer" plan will be announced soon.
