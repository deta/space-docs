## Step 1: Code configuration

You can use any project stucture you like, but you must have a file named `requirements.txt` at the root of your project that list the dependencies of your app.

### Starlette

Here is an example of a simple Starlette app:

`main.py`

```python
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse


async def app(scope, receive, send):
    assert scope['type'] == 'http'
    response = PlainTextResponse('Hello, Space!')
    await response(scope, receive, send)
```

### FastAPI

Here is an example of a simple FastAPI app:

`main.py`

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "Space!"}
```

### Flask

Here is an example of a simple Flask app:

`main.py`

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    return "Hello, Space!"
```

## Step 2: Run it on Space

Make sure you have the Space CLI installed & authenticated, then run the following command:

```bash
space new
```

This will create a new Space project in the current directory.

Edit the generated `Spacefile` to add a `run` command for your app:

```yaml
v: 0
micros:
  - name: python-app
    src: .
    engine: python3.9
    run: uvicorn main:app
```

The `run` command should start your Python app's HTTP server and listen on the port specified by the `PORT` environment variable. If you are using `uvicorn` the right port will be chosen automatically.

You can then run the following command to push your code to Space:

```bash
space push
```

Great job! You've just deployed your Python app on Space. You can now access your app at the URL provided by the CLI.

## Limitations

- Space only supports Python 3.8 and 3.9
- Space only supports ASGI and WSGI apps (HTTP servers). So raw scripts won't work.
- Only `/tmp` is writable
- SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL are not supported (we recommend using [Deta Base](/docs/en/reference/base/sdk), which is built into every Space app by default)
- Total size of deployed app is limited to 250MB (including dependencies, source code, etc). So many large dependencies like `numpy` or `streamlit` might not work, as well as larger models.

## Setting up local development

We recommend using virtual environment for local development. If you have listed your app dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file, you can install them to your virtual environment with the following commands:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment in the current directory
python -m venv .venv
# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If you are using FastAPI, you will also need to install uvicorn
pip install uvicorn[standard]
```

Then you will need to setup the dev command inside your Spacefile. Just reference the executable file from your virtual environment:

```yaml
  - name: python-app
    src: ./src/python
    engine: python3.9
    run: uvicorn main:app
    dev: .venv/bin/uvicorn main:app --reload
```
