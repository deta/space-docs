Deta Base is a fully-managed, fast, scalable and secure NoSQL database with a focus on end-user simplicity. It offers a UI through which you can easily see, query, update and delete records in the database.

## What can Deta Base be used for?

Deta Base is great for projects where configuring and maintaining a database is overkill or when you want to store data as part of [building a Space app](/docs/en/basics/data).

Examples:

- Serverless applications
- Internal tools
- Stateful integrations
- Hackathons and side projects
- Prototyping

## Getting started
