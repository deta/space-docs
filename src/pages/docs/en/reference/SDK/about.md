The Deta library is the easiest way to store and retrieve data from your Deta Base. Currently, we support JavaScript (Node + Browser), Python 3 and Go. [Drop us a line on Discord](https://go.deta.dev/discord) if you want us to support your favorite language.

Deta provides SDK packages to let you interact with [Base](../base/about) and [Drive](../drive/about) from your code.
The SDKs are available for the following languages:

- [Python](./python)
- [JavaScript](./javascript)
- [Go](./go)
