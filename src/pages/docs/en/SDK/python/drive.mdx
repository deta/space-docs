### Put

```py
def put(
    name: str,
    data: str | bytes | io.TextIOBase | io.BufferedIOBase | io.RawIOBase,
    *,
    content_type: str | None = None,
) -> str:
```

```py
def put(
    name: str,
    *,
    path: str,
    content_type: str | None = None,
) -> str:
```

Uploads and stores a file with a given name. It will overwrite the file if the name already exists.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `str` | The name of the file. |
| `data` | `str` \| `bytes` \| `io.TextIOBase` \| `io.BufferedIOBase` \| `io.RawIOBase` | The data content of the file. |
| `path` | `str` | The local path of the file to be uploaded to drive. |
| `content_type` | `str` \| `None` | The content type of the file to be uploaded to drive. If the content type is not provided, Drive tries to figure out the content type from the `name` provided. It defaults to `application/octet-stream` if the content type can not be determined. |

You must pass either `data` or `path`, but not both.

If successful, returns an `str` containing the file's name
If unsuccessful, raises an `Exception`.

### Get

```py
def get(self, name: str) -> Optional[DriveStreamingBody]:
```

`Get` retrieves a file from a drive by its name.

**`get(name)`**

#### Parameters

- **name** (required) - `string`
  - Description: The `name` of the file to get.

#### Returns

Returns a instance of a `DriveStreamingBody` class which has the following methods/properties.

- `read(size=None)` : Reads all or up to the next `size` bytes. Calling `read` after all the content has been read will return empty bytes.
- `iter_chunks(chunk_size:int=1024)` : Returns an iterator that yields chunks of bytes of `chunk_size` at a time.
- `iter_lines(chunk_size:int=1024)` : Returns an iterator that yields lines from the stream. Bytes of `chunk_size` at a time is read from the raw stream and lines are yielded from there. The line delimiter is always `b'\n'`.
- `close()` : Closes the stream.
- `closed` : Returns `True` if the stream has been closed.

### Delete

`Delete` deletes a file from drive.

**`delete(name)`**

#### Parameters

- **name** (required) - `string`
  - Description: The name of the file to delete

#### Returns

Returns the `name` of the deleted file on successful deletions, otherwise raises an `Exception`

> If the file did not exist, the file is still returned as deleted.

### Delete Many

Deletes multiple files (up to 1000) from a drive.

**`delete_many(names)`**

#### Parameters

- **names** (required): `string`
  - Description: The names of the files to be deleted.

#### Returns

Returns a `dict` with `deleted` and `failed` keys indicating deleted and failed file names.

> If a file did not exist, the file is still returned as deleted.

### List

`List` files in your drive.

**`list(limit, prefix, last)`**

#### Parameters

- **limit**: `int`
  - Description: The maximum number of files names to be returned, defaults to `1000`
- **prefix**: `string`
  - Description: The prefix that file names must have.
- **last**: `string`
  - Description: The `last` name seen in a previous paginated result. Provide `last` from previous response to fetch further pages.

#### Returns

Returns a `dict` with `paging` and `names` keys.

- `names`: The names of the files
- `paging`: Contains paging information.
  - `size` : The number of files returned.
  - `last` : The last name seen in the paginated response. Provide this value in subsequent api calls to fetch further pages. For the last page, `last` is not present in the response.
