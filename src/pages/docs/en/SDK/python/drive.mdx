### Put

```py
put(
    name: str,
    data: str | bytes| io.TextIOBase | io.BufferedIOBase | io.RawIOBase,
    *,
    content_type: str | None = None,
)
```

```py
put(
    name: str,
    *,
    path: str,
    content_type: str | None = None,
)
```

`Put` uploads and stores a file in a drive with a given `name`. It will overwrite the file if the file name already exists.

**`put(name, data, *, path, content_type)`**

#### Parameters

- **name** (required) - `string`
  - Description: The name of the file.
- **data** - `string | bytes | io.TextIOBase | io.BufferedIOBase | io.RawIOBase`
  - Description: The data content of the file.
- **path** - `string`
  - Description: The local path of the file to be uploaded to drive.
- **content_type** - `string`

  - Description: The content type of the file to be uploaded to drive. If the content type is not provided, `drive` tries to figure out the content type from the `name` provided. It defaults to `application/octet-stream` if the content type can not be figured out from the file name.

  At least and at most one of two args `data` or `path` must be provided. `path` and `content_type` must be provided with the key words.

#### Returns

Returns the name of the file on a successful `put`, otherwise, raises an `Exception` on error.

### Get

`Get` retrieves a file from a drive by its name.

**`get(name)`**

#### Parameters

- **name** (required) - `string`
  - Description: The `name` of the file to get.

#### Returns

Returns a instance of a `DriveStreamingBody` class which has the following methods/properties.

- `read(size=None)` : Reads all or up to the next `size` bytes. Calling `read` after all the content has been read will return empty bytes.
- `iter_chunks(chunk_size:int=1024)` : Returns an iterator that yields chunks of bytes of `chunk_size` at a time.
- `iter_lines(chunk_size:int=1024)` : Returns an iterator that yields lines from the stream. Bytes of `chunk_size` at a time is read from the raw stream and lines are yielded from there. The line delimiter is always `b'\n'`.
- `close()` : Closes the stream.
- `closed` : Returns `True` if the stream has been closed.

### Delete

`Delete` deletes a file from drive.

**`delete(name)`**

#### Parameters

- **name** (required) - `string`
  - Description: The name of the file to delete

#### Returns

Returns the `name` of the deleted file on successful deletions, otherwise raises an `Exception`

> If the file did not exist, the file is still returned as deleted.

### Delete Many

Deletes multiple files (up to 1000) from a drive.

**`delete_many(names)`**

#### Parameters

- **names** (required): `string`
  - Description: The names of the files to be deleted.

#### Returns

Returns a `dict` with `deleted` and `failed` keys indicating deleted and failed file names.

> If a file did not exist, the file is still returned as deleted.

### List

`List` files in your drive.

**`list(limit, prefix, last)`**

#### Parameters

- **limit**: `int`
  - Description: The maximum number of files names to be returned, defaults to `1000`
- **prefix**: `string`
  - Description: The prefix that file names must have.
- **last**: `string`
  - Description: The `last` name seen in a previous paginated result. Provide `last` from previous response to fetch further pages.

#### Returns

Returns a `dict` with `paging` and `names` keys.

- `names`: The names of the files
- `paging`: Contains paging information.
  - `size` : The number of files returned.
  - `last` : The last name seen in the paginated response. Provide this value in subsequent api calls to fetch further pages. For the last page, `last` is not present in the response.
