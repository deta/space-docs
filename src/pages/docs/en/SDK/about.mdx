The Deta library is the easiest way to store and retrieve data from your Deta Base. Currently, we support JavaScript (Node + Browser), Python 3 and Go. [Drop us a line on Discord](https://go.deta.dev/discord) if you want us to support your favorite language.

Deta provides SDK packages to let you interact with [Base](../base/about) and [Drive](../drive/about) from your code.
The SDKs are available for the following languages:

- [Python](./python)
- [JavaScript](./javascript)
- [Go](./go)

> ℹ️ If you are using the Deta SDK within a [Deta Micro](/docs/en/basics/micros#whats-a-micro), you must include `deta` in your `package.json` file to install the latest sdk version.

## Instantiating

To start working with the SDK, you need to either use the `space dev` command or provide a data key in an environment variable called `DETA_PROJECT_KEY`.
See [Developing with Base and Drive](/docs/en/basics/data#developing-with-base-and-drive) for detailed information.

> ⚠️ Your data key is confidential and meant to be used by you. Anyone who has your data key can access your database. Please, do not share it or commit it in your code.
