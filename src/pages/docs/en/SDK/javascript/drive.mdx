## Put

```js
async function put(
    name: string,
    options: PutOptions,
): Promise<PutResponse>;
```

Uploads and stores a file with a given name. It will overwrite the file if the name already exists.

| Parameter | Type                                 | Description                               |

| `options` | [`PutOptions`](./types#putoptions-1) | An object with three optional parameters. |

`options` must have exactly one of two properties `data` or `path` defined.

`data` is a `Blob` or `ArrayBuffer` of the file data.

`path` is a `string` of the path to the file on the local filesystem.

If successful, returns a promise which resolves to a [`PutResponse`](./types#putresponse-1) containing the name of the item.
If unsuccessful, raises an `Error`.

```

Retrieves a file by its name.

| --------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| `name`    | `string` | The name of the file to get. |

If successful, returns a promise that resolves to a [`GetResponse`](./types#getresponse-1) containing a `Blob` of the data if found, otherwise `null`.
If unsuccessful, raises an `Error`.

## Delete

```js
async function delete(name: string): Promise<DeleteResponse>;
```
