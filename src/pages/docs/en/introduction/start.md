At Deta, we are building a personal computer that lives in the cloud â€” a personal cloud â€” for individual software developers. We call it Deta Space.

On Deta Space, each user of an app gets their own sandboxed copy of the app, which contains its own micro-servers, databases and file stores.

Learn more about our vision on the [Why Deta Space](/docs/en/introduction/why-deta) page and check out our [intro to the Personal Cloud](/docs/en/introduction/personal-cloud) for an overview of the core concepts.

With the personal cloud, we see a future where individuals are empowered with apps & data that:
- are hackable & extensible
- are seamlessly interoperable
- are fully backed up, with rollbacks
- support groups of people collaborating in real time

Most importantly, we plan to earn money *with developers* who want to monetize their creations.

## âœ¨ Key features

Deta Space is standing behind you, fully.

- **Fully managed servers**: App developers have an ops burden of zero, as they scale their users to space.

- **Fully managed data**: App developers don't have to worry about user data/compliance.

- **Fully managed security**: App developers don't think about security and auth - each user gets their own sandboxed app with managed auth.

- **Fully managed payments**: App developers can earn money with their apps, activated easy-peasy (planned).
