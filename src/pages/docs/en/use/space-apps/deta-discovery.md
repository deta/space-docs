If you find an app from the Discovery home page that you’re curious about, clicking it will bring you to an individual app’s Discovery page. You may also land on an app’s Discovery page from an external site, or if someone shared a Discovery link with you.

In the background, Space is pulling a copy of the app from Discovery and provisioning the compute and data resources to run the app out of your Space.
