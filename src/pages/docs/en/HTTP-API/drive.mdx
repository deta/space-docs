## General

> ðŸ’¡ You can get your **Project Key** and your **Project ID** of your project in [Builder](https://deta.space/builder). You need these to talk with the Deta Drive API.

### Root URL
This URL is the base for all your HTTP requests:

**`https://drive.deta.sh/v1/{project_id}/{drive_name}`**

> The `drive_name` is the name given to your drive. If you already have a **Drive**, then you can go ahead and provide it's name here. Additionally, you could provide any name here when doing any `PUT` or `POST` request and our backend will automatically create a new drive for you if it does not exist. There is no limit on how many "Drives" you can create.

### Auth
A **Project Key** _must_ be provided in the request **headers** as a value for the `X-Api-Key` key for authentication and authorization.

Example `X-Api-Key: a0kjsdfjda_thisIsYourSecretKey`

### File Names And Directories
Each file needs a unique `name` which identifies the file. Directorial hierarchies are represented logically by the `name` of the file itself with the use of backslash `/`. 

For example, if you want to store a file `world.txt` under the directory `hello` , the `name` of the file should be `hello/world.txt`.  

The file name **must not** end with a `/`. This also means that you can not create an empty directory.

A directory ceases to exist if there are no more files in it.
## Endpoints
### Put File
`POST /files?name={name}`

Stores a smaller file in a single request. Use this endpoint if the file size is small enough to be sent in a single request. The file is overwritten if the file with given `name` already exists.

> We do not accept payloads larger than 10 Mb on this endpoint. For larger uploads, use chunked uploads.

If the response is paginated, the response contains a `paging` object with `size` and `last` keys; `size` is the number of file
names in the response, and `last` is the last file name seen in the response. The value of `last` should be used in subsequent
requests to continue recieving further pages.
