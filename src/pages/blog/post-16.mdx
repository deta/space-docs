For developers, much of the power of the [personal cloud](https://deta.space/docs/en/learn/what-is-pc) is the [auth model](https://deta.space/docs/en/build/fundamentals/the-space-runtime/authentication).

In Space you can build a personal app for yourself, and you can see it run for just about anyone in the world with an internet connection. No need to consider sign-in, sign-up, users, or data separation. The power of auth on the personal cloud is… not thinking about auth. Because it just works.

From today—you can think even less. With version 2 of the Deta JavaScript SDK you can now use [Deta Base](https://deta.space/docs/en/build/fundamentals/data-storage#deta-base) or 
[Deta Drive](https://deta.space/docs/en/build/fundamentals/data-storage#deta-drive) straight from your browser. So, for many apps, you can stop worrying about backends entirely.

Previously, when building a personal app, you needed to create an entire backend, writing APIs that routed user requests in the browser and back to the data in Base or Drive. That meant a whole lot of drudgery and clients having to go through a backend [Micro](https://deta.space/docs/en/build/fundamentals/the-space-runtime/micros) to store and retrieve data. It also added latency to user actions as they waited on a backend Micro to respond (cough cough, cold starts). For many apps, that’s in the past now.

Read on to discover how you can start living backend-worry free in v2.


## Deta JavaScript SDK, v2

To get started using Deta Base or Drive in the browser install the latest Deta SDK from npm (or yarn):

```bash
npm install deta@latest
```

Or import it into your app from Space’s CDN:

```js
const deta = await import("https://cdn.deta.space/js/deta@2.0.0/deta.mjs");
```

Now your app can start reading and writing data in the browser:

```js
const base = deta.Base('my-base');
const drive = deta.Drive('my-drive');

await base.putMany(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']);
await drive.put('a', {data: 'data'});
await drive.put('b', {data: 'data'});
await drive.put('c', {data: 'data'});
await drive.put('d', {data: 'data'});

console.log(await base.fetch());
console.log(await drive.list());
```

If your app is running on Deta Space it will just work. No need for keys or a backend, Just low-latency personal applications. Check out [this repo](https://github.com/deta/todo-app) for an example app that uses the new SDK on the client.

Deta Team member and author of [PingBack](https://deta.space/discovery/@maximilianheidenreich/pingback), Maxu, had this to say after getting his hands on an early release:
> *"Some ppl. try to avoid writing API routes and use React & Next.JS server components. I avoid both with the Browser SDK. Instant 10x."*

A few notes:
- The Browser SDK supports all the same methods and features as the existing SDK
- The Browser SDK will not work on [public Micros or Public Routes](https://deta.space/docs/en/build/fundamentals/the-space-runtime/authentication#public-micros-and-routes)
- The Browser SDK

## More Fun Things

### Base Sort Order

After persistent requests and hacky hacks, we’re pleased to share that you can now sort your Base items by ascending or descending key order. Simply pass a desc value to any Fetch call ([docs](https://deta.space/docs/en/build/reference/sdk/types#fetchoptions)).

With Python:
```py
db = deta.Base("random-base")

db.fetch(desc=True)
```

With JavaScript:
```js
const db= deta.Base('random-base');

db.fetch({desc: true})
```
*This works in the browser with the new SDK ;)*

If you check the key column in any [Base UI](https://deta.space/docs/en/use/your-data/guis#base-ui) view, you'll also notice a toggle that gives you the same ability.

### Python SDK: Async Base

We now have support asynchronous interactions with Deta Base in the Python SDK. See the "Python (async)" tab [in the docs for more](https://deta.space/docs/en/build/reference/sdk).

```py
from deta import Deta

deta = Deta() #instantiate with a Data Key, or env DETA_PROJECT_KEY

db = deta.AsyncBase("my_db")

await db.put({"name": "alex", "age": 77, "key": "one"})

await db.put({"name": "alex", "age": 23}, "alex23", expire_in=300)

# close db session
await db.close()
```
