We are sprinting towards the big merge, where Deta Cloud gets merged into Space. This means, overnight, tens of thousands of doers and dreamers get to experience Deta Space. This as an opportunity for you and your ideas to shine in a big way: a chance to make it to the Deta homepage (and to win some galactic goodies). 

So we‚Äôre inviting everyone to ***sprint with us*** and build in a ***Deta‚Äôs first Shipathon***.


## üèóÔ∏è - Challenge

Build and launch something using Deta Space until next Sunday, February 12th EOD (CET).

What could you build?

- An entirely new app
- A feature for an existing app
- A port of an OSS app (or an app you already built) to Space


## üéÅ - Prizes

### Domains

We‚Äôre gifting up to ***25*** domains and sticker packs to every substantial launch!

Here‚Äôs a few examples from the community of recently released apps that meet this threshold:

- New Apps: [Wordle on Space](https://deta.space/discovery/@sofa/wordle), [SnapSend](https://deta.space/discovery/@bagaswastu/snapsend), [Koyo](https://deta.space/discovery/@theboringdude/koyo), etc.
- Feature: White Holes in [Black Hole](https://deta.space/discovery/@mikhailsdv/black_hole-3kf)
- Ports: [Method Draw](https://deta.space/discovery/@deta-team/method-draw)

### Discord Nitro for Scheduled Actions

The team will select the best app using a [Scheduled Action](https://deta.space/changelog/post-8) and the winner will get 6 months of Discord Nitro paid for by the Deta Treasury.

(The Scheduled Action doesn't have to be the app's main feature).

### Grand Prize 

*Get your app featured on the new Deta homepage and 2 Deta Space T-Shirts!*

## üì§ - Submission

To submit your hack, launch an app to Deta Discovery and share the Discovery link before the deadline via **[this form](https://formate-1-a8705222.deta.app/f/shipathon-feb-2023-submissions)**.

Multiple submissions are accepted, and you can work with others (but will need to share the prize, per submission).
