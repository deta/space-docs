## 💾  Highlighted Apps

### Pollster: polls to "make every voice count"

***→ [Install Pollster](https://deta.space/discovery/@aarushth/pollster)***

Pollster won the [grand prize of Sprint to Space](https://deta.space/blog_assets/sprint-to-space), offering a solution for creating and running polls. The team really likes the UI and Pollster feels like a complete and polished app. 

### Formate: forms in minutes

***→ [Install Formate](https://deta.space/discovery/@deta/formate)***

Formate lets you create forms in minutes. It was built by a former working student at Deta and supports a variety of question types. The community is already integrating [other apps with Formate](https://deta.space/discovery/@milynnus/formate_smtp) using [Data Keys](https://deta.space/changelog/post-6).

### Moonliver: personal live streaming

***→ [Install Moonliver](https://deta.space/discovery/@kokoro/moonliver-ba1)***

Moonliver is a personal live streaming platform, built during the [Sprint to Space](https://deta.space/blog_assets/sprint-to-space). Moonliver has blown our minds, surprising us with the limits of what is possible to build in Space. 

Building something cool? [Let us know on Discord](https://go.deta.dev/discord).

## 😺 Sprint to Space Shipathon

### Lots of Apps, Lots of Winners

The community built 20 apps for the **[Sprint to Space Shipathon](https://deta.space/blog_assets/sprint-to-space)**. **Incredible.**

The **grand prize** goes to **[Pollster](https://deta.space/discovery/@aarushth/pollster).** Congratulations Aarush!

Shoutout to everyone who delivered & make sure to [check out the rest of the winners on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/827546555200438332/831945258228908112/1077707811070431314). We’ll be contacting everyone next week for prizes.

<img src="/blog_assets/newsletters/01/edit-mode.webp" style="max-width: 736px; margin: auto;"/>
</div>
<br />

With “**Edit Mode**” you can now add, modify, and delete data **for any app you install.** Use responsibly.

Read more about **Edit Mode** and other fixes in our changelog.

### Featured Feature: Public Routes

*Can you use or share an app or API without auth, so anyone can access it?*

***Yes!*** To do this, just add a [`public_routes`](https://deta.space/docs/en/basics/micros#public-routes) parameter to your [Spacefile](https://deta.space/docs/en/reference/spacefile#whats-the-spacefile) before you push to Space. You can control what’s public on a route level basis.

## 🍳 What’s Cooking?

### Coming Soon

We’ve been busy drinking Coke Zero and building:
- a better local dev experience with the Space CLI
- the ability to hide and delete releases
- stricter requirements for publishing listed releases to Deta Discovery

Have a feature request? [Let us know on Discord](https://go.deta.dev/discord).
