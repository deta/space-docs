## New Build Pipeline

We have been working hard on a revamped build pipeline that is more reliable, easier to maintain and provides a few improvements for developers building Space apps as well.

Most of the changes happened in the pipeline itself, but for some we also had to update the Space CLI. To take advantage of all improvements you need to upgrade the CLI to the latest version:

```bash
space version upgrade
```

### Improved Logs

We reworked the build logs to be easier to read and more informative.

```
$ space push

You will also notice that the logs are now streamed in real-time, so you can see the progress of your build as it happens.

### Node apps now use the right package manager

In our previous pipeline, we defaulted to using `yarn` to install dependencies.
This worked fine for most applications, but some users were hitting issues when using `pnpm` or `npm` instead.

We now dynamically detect which package manager to use based on the presence of a lockfile.

### Smaller Node Apps

We no longer bundle the node_modules directory for engines that don't require it.
If your app use the `nodejs16` engine and has a build step, you can provide an `include` array in your Spacefile to exclude the `node_modules` directory from your build.
