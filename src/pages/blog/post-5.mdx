Ever wanted to connect to your app programmatically without logging in with a browser? It's now possible thanks to API keys!

## Features

### API Keys

If you want to allow access to a Micro's private routes you can now enable the `api_keys` preset for Micros in your Spacefile:

```yaml
micros:
  - name: api
    src: ./api/
    engine: python3.9
    presets:
      api_keys: true
```

If enabled, users of your app will be able to generate API keys in their app's settings and use them to make authenticated requests to otherwise private routes of a Micro.

Here are some cool use cases that are now possible:

- Connect to your app from a browser extension
- Call an API route of your app from an external program
- Let two Space apps talk to each other

If you want to add API keys to your Space app, make sure to update your `space` CLI with `space version upgrade`.

Learn more about API keys and how to use them in the [docs](/docs/en/basics/micros#api-keys).

API keys are just the beginning, we have lots of other features around interoperability and access control planned for the future. Stay tuned!


Thanks for being a crucial part in the early stages of Space and for all the great feedback we have received!
