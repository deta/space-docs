At Deta we’ve been a bit quiet over the past couple months. But we’ve been hard at work on a major upgrade on top of [Space OS & Horizon](https://deta.space/blog/space-os). We’ll be unveiling more in a ***special event on March 14***, with a wider launch scheduled for Q2.

What we are working on is already usable in early access — it just has a lot of rough edges.  We’re looking for a small group of enthusiasts (~30) - Voyagers -  to help us refine these rough edges over the next two months. 

If the ideas behind Space OS and a fresh approach to engaging with personal computers & the internet sound exciting, we encourage you to reach out.

As a Space Voyager, you’ll get access to our next major products pre-launch, a strong voice in the product direction, participation in a private community of other early adopters, and a limited edition Space T-Shirt.

Sounds fun? [Let us know](https://form.typeform.com/to/FATYEvUS)

*P.S. You may have applied [in November](/blog/space-voyagers). We fumbled on following through with the program - the timing was bad and we didn’t have the resources in place; now it’s better and we do. If you're still interested, please fill out the new form!*
