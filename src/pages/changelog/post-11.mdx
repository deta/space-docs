---

Since the introduction of Deta Space, we have receive a lot of requests for local development support.
We are happy to announce that the new version of the Space CLI now supports this usecase.

## A new way to run your app locally

From the root of your project, just run the following command:

```
space dev
```

Et voila! You app is now running locally and you can access it at `http://localhost:4200`.
Add the `--open` flag to open the app in your browser automatically.

Behind the scenes, the Space CLI is:

- Generating a data key to allow your app to access the Bases and Drives of your project
- Running each of your micro in a separate process
- Exposing all of your micros through a single entrypoint.

For more information, make sure to check out the [docs](/docs/en/basics/local).

## Triggering Scheduled Action from the CLI

Scheduled actions allow an app to perform certain tasks on a specific interval.
These tasks can be anything you build into your app, from a cleanup job to automated data aggregation or revalidation.

```yaml
micros:
  - name: backend
    src: backend
    engine: nodejs16
    run: "node index.js"
    actions:
      - id: "cleanup"
        name: "Clean Up"
        description: "Cleans up unused data"
        trigger: "schedule"
        default_interval: "0/15 * * * *"
```

The new version of the Space CLI allows you to test your scheduled actions locally.

```bash
space dev trigger cleanup
```

Behind the scenes, the Space CLI will:
    - Send the action event your micro using the same event format as the Space platform
    - Print the returned response to your console (if any)

## Upgrading to the new version

To upgrade to the new version of the Space CLI, just run the following command:

```
space version upgrade
```
