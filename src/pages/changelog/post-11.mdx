---

Since the introduction of Deta Space, we have receive a lot of requests for local development support.
We are happy to announce that the new version of the Space CLI now supports this usecase.

## The `space dev` command

From the root of your project, just run the following command:

```
space dev
```

Et voila! You app is now running locally and you can access it at `http://localhost:4200`.
Add the `--open` flag to open the app in your browser automatically.

Behind the scenes, the Space CLI is:

- Generate a data key to allow your app to access the Bases and Drives of your project
- Running each of your micro in a separate process
- Exposing all of your micros through a single entrypoint.

## Customizing the dev command

By default we automatically try to choose the right command to start your Micro in development mode based on the Micro's engine. This currently only works for static engines like `svelte`, `vue` and `react` as well as fullstack frameworks like `next`, `nuxt` and `sveltekit`. 

If your Micro has different requirements or needs more setup, like a `node`, `python` or `custom` Micro, use the `dev` option in the `Spacefile` to specify a Micro's development command yourself:

```yaml
v: 0
micros:
  - name: app
    src: ./app
    engine: nodejs16
    primary: true
    run: "node index.js"
    dev: "nodemon index.js"
```


More information can be found in the [Space CLI documentation](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/cli/space/dev).

## Supporting Power Users

Of course, we know that some of you are power users and want to have more control over your local development environment.

Instead of running `space dev`, you can run each of your micros manually, and then start the reverse proxy yourself.

More information can be found in the [Space CLI documentation](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/cli/space/dev).

## Upgrading to the new version

To upgrade to the new version of the Space CLI, just run the following command:

```
space version upgrade
```
