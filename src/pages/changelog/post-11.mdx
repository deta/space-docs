Since the introduction of Deta Space, developers have been asking for a better experience when building locally for Space. Whether it is managing keys or coordinating between two separate [Micros](https://deta.space/docs/en/basics/micros#whats-a-micro), local development requires unnecessary work.

We are happy to announce that the newest Space CLI can now do a lot of the heavy lifting, with a single command: `space dev`.

## `space dev`: run your Space app locally

If you've got a Space project you want to run locally, just run the following command, from the root of your project:

```
space dev
```

Et voila! Your app is now running locally and you can access it at `http://localhost:4200` (the Space CLI will tell you this).
You can also add the `--open` flag to open the app in your browser automatically.

Behind the scenes, the Space CLI is:

- Generating and injecting a [Data Key](https://deta.space/changelog/post-6) to allow your app to write data to your project
- Running each of your Micros in a separate process (using a new `dev` command from your Spacefile)
- Exposing all of your Micros through a single entrypoint (following the routing in your Spacefile)

For more information on how setup and use the command, make sure to check out the [docs](/docs/en/basics/local).

## Triggering Scheduled Actions from the CLI

If your Spacefile contains a [Scheduled Action](https://deta.space/docs/en/basics/micros#scheduled-actions), you can also now trigger it locally for testing.

For example, if you have the following Spacefile:

```yaml
micros:
  - name: backend
    src: backend
    engine: nodejs16
    run: "node index.js"
    dev: "nodemon index.js"
    actions:
      - id: "cleanup"
        name: "Clean Up"
        description: "Cleans up unused data"
        trigger: "schedule"
        default_interval: "0/15 * * * *"
```

After starting the app locally with `space dev`, you can now trigger the `cleanup` action by running the following command:

```bash
space dev trigger cleanup
```

Behind the scenes, the Space CLI will:
    - Send the action event to your Micro locally
    - Print the returned response to your console (if any)

## Running local scripts against your project's Bases & Drives

The `space exec` commands allows you to give a local command or script access to your project's Deta Base and Drive data. It does so by creating and injecting a [Data Key](https://deta.space/changelog/post-6) as `DETA_PROJECT_KEY` into your local environment.

```
space exec --project <project-id> -- node init-database.js
```

Some use cases include:

- testing Base & Drive locally
- pre-filling your projects Bases & Drives with data
- programmatically interacting with Base & Drive
- … anything else you can think of!

## Upgrading to the new CLI

To use all the new commands, make sure to upgrade to the latest version of the Space CLI, with the following command:

```
space version upgrade
```

That's all for now. Thank you for all the feedback — please continue to share!
