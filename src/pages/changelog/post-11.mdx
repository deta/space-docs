Since the introduction of Deta Space, we have receive a lot of requests for local development support.
We are happy to announce that the new version of the Space CLI now supports this usecase.

## The `space dev` command

From the root of your project, just run the following command:

```
space dev
```

Et voila! You app is now running locally and you can access it at `http://localhost:4200`.
Add the `--open` flag to open the app in your browser automatically.

Behind the scenes, the Space CLI is:

- Generate a project key to allow your app to access it's Deta Base and Deta Drive
- Running each of your micro in a separate process
- Exposing all of your micros through a single entrypoint.

## Customizing the dev command

Of course, each micros might have different requirements, and you might want to customize the `dev command` for each of them.

You can do this specifying the command to run for each micro in your `Spacefile` using the `dev` field.

More information can be found in the [Space CLI documentation](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/cli/space/dev).

## Supporting Power Users

Of course, we know that some of you are power users and want to have more control over your local development environment.

Instead of running `space dev`, you can run each of your micros manually, and then start the reverse proxy yourself.

More information can be found in the [Space CLI documentation](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/cli/space/dev).

## Upgrading to the new version

To upgrade to the new version of the Space CLI, just run the following command:

```
space version upgrade
```
