Over the past few weeks, we have received a lot of feedback and bug reports from the community around the Space CLI. We have been working hard to address these issues and improve the overall experience of using the Space CLI in the last few days and weeks and are excited to release a new version.

To upgrade run the following command:

```bash
space version upgrade
```

If you haven't installed the CLI yet, you can do so by following [the instructions in our docs](https://deta.space/docs/en/basics/cli#installation).

## Updated `space push` command

We have updated the `space push` command to now follow the entire process of not just pushing and building your app, but also updating your Builder instance with the latest revision. This means you'll now have more insight into the process of updating your Builder instance with the latest changes. Once the build and update is complete it will print your Builder instance's URL to the console and you can optionally even open it in your browser automatically by passing the `--open` flag:

```bash
$ space push --open

Run space release to create a release that others can install.

If this process is too long for you and you just want to push your code and start the build you can pass the `--skip-logs` flag to skip the build logs and exit the command once the build is started. You can then view the status of your build in the Builder UI:

```bash
$ space push --skip-logs

## New `space open` command

To make it easier to go from your terminal to the Builder UI we have added a new `space open` command. This command will open your current project in the Builder UI in your browser.

```bash
space open
```

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

- Fix issue with invalid access token or unauthorized error even when token is valid in Windows
- Fix Micro `src` being shown instead of the engine for engine validation errors

Thank you for all the valuable feedback â€” please continue to share your thoughts as we work to build and improve Space.
