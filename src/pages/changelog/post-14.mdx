## New Build Pipeline

We have been working hard on a revamped build pipeline that is more reliable, easier to maintain and provides a few improvements for developers building Space apps as well.

### Improved Logs

We reworked the build logs to be easier to read and more informative.

You will also notice that the logs are now streamed in real-time, so you can see the progress of your build as it happens.

### Node apps now use the right package manager

In our previous pipeline, we defaulted to using `yarn` to install dependencies.
This worked fine for most applications, but some users were hitting issues when using `pnpm` or `npm` instead.

We now dynamically detect which package manager to use based on the presence of a lockfile.

### Smaller Node Apps

We no longer bundle the node_modules directory for engines that don't require it.
If your app use the `nodejs16` engine and has a build step, you can provide an `include` array in your Spacefile to exclude the `node_modules` directory from your build.
